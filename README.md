# Final-Project-
this is a analist on how loans are given out and answering some questions about the data 

1) this data is about infomation about how loans are given to people base on mutiple different factors ( this includes gender, education, purpose, amount, credit score, type of loan). now this data set was choosen because I wanted to answer some personal questions I had about how to get an loans and factors that could help me or hurt me in getting my loan

now the steps I took wa the following:

1)  importing and clean the data: I use the cvs method to import the data and also imported the libraries need it. I also use the count funtion to see if there was any missing values in the data, and use the describe funtion to also see if the buisness rules were proeprly use and there was not miss understaning

2) Data manipulation: i use the group me fuction twice for this project because it fit what I need it. the first time I use it was to see if you were more like it to get an loan base on your education so I grouped the education type and the amount of arproval each different type of education gets you, and after seeing the inside we see that bachelor education is more likely to give you the loan.

the second time I use it was to see what wa the average loan depeding on the type of loan that the people use the money for. first I use value count to find the different type of loans that people were getting and I use the group funtion to get them together depeding on they type and them find the mean of each different type of loans. after we get our result the loan type that has the highest amount is the home improvent loans, that have an average of 10,419$ per loan. 

4) Data Visualisation: I create 3 visual for this graph, 2 bars and 1 scatter plot ( the scatter is the one that is more confusing, let me explain it here) the fist one was a stack bar graph to see the amount of loans that were aprove and not aprove depending on education. now I create it using Seaborn because it more simple to create them. they were create to see the visual of the data.

the second graph was also create using Seaborn and was use to graph the average loan amount for different types of loans. seeing the graph we see that they are close each other but the home maintaments is the one that has the highest amount.

THIS ONE IS THE MOST CONFUSING: the scatter plot was the hardets one because I use the build in funtion of seaborn to make them. now to explain the graph, the Y values is fine with is the amount of loans, the X values is were it gets interesting. each tick mark represent a type of income for the people. the average is around 80,000$ for a person income, with is about 0 to 1 tick mark, the more the tick the bigger is the amount using the scientic notation. the last dot the person makes over 7 millions dollars. with is an outlier in the data because is far away from the rest of the data.

5) Statistic Analysis: I use this to find out if the data had follow buisness rules and to find out information for the amount of the loan. this is how I use this type of anaylsis

   thank you for taking the time to review my project, I would love feeback on how to improve it and thank you for taking your time. have an awsome day :)
